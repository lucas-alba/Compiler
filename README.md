CSC 370 Complier Project

## Assigment 

Basic requirement: Designing a compiler for a Simple Programming Language involves creating a software system that can translate code written in the Simple Programming Language (SPL) into machine code that can be executed on a computer. The project would involve:

1. Defining the syntax of the SPL, including its basic data types, control structures, and functions.
2. Implementing a lexical analyzer to tokenize the SPL source code into a stream of tokens.
3. Implementing a parser to construct an abstract syntax tree (AST) from the token stream
that represents the structure of the program.
4. Implementing a semantic analyzer to check for type errors, undefined variables, and other
semantic errors in the program.
5. Generating intermediate code from the AST, such as three-address code or bytecode.
6. Optimizing the intermediate code to improve the efficiency of the generated machine code.
7. Generating the final machine code, such as x86 assembly language, that can be executed
on a computer.


## Usage 
- Type into the filename.txt
- Follows a close syntax for BASIC
- Does not support Strings
- Prints TAC and Optimized in console 
- Prints x86 code in assembly.txt
